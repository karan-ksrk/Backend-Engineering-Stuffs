Microservices technology is a new pattern of software engineering that has been popularized recently. In this video, we will explain what microservices are, their pros and cons by example. 

A lot of companies have moved in early 2010 such as  Twitter and Netflix to the microservices architecture.   In order to explain what microservices are, we need to explain how a traditional classical application looks like

Microservices Pros:
Polyglot architecture 
Easy scaling for microservices that needs scaling. 
Better Team management, each microservice is a team
Easier to innovate certain areas.
Each microservice can pick their own database 
Scale busy services instead of the entire system 

Microservices Cons:
Very complicated to implement, network call, service discovery 
Very Difficult to debug
Hard to find where the fault is 
Network calls fail adds complexity.
